# AntMaze

Given a maze where B is the Beginning, a # indicates walls which the mouse cannot pass, a period indicating an open path, and a S indicating a sugar piece for the ant. The ant traverses the maze and prints out the traversed maze with the amount of pieces of sugar that it found. The main file is AntMaze.cs.
